🚀 **About Me**

I'm a JavaScript and TypeScript developer with 6+ years of commercial experience, combining strong technical expertise with leadership skills in managing software development lifecycles.

Throughout my career, I have successfully:
- Built and optimized development processes (CI/CD, testing, release management)
- Led frontend architecture redesigns (FSD, scalable solutions)
- Delivered measurable business results (reducing production errors, increasing KPIs)
- Supported full project cycles from initial design to production launch

My experience spans:
- **Frontend Development:** React.js, Next.js, Redux, Apollo Client, Svelte
- **Backend and APIs:** Node.js (Express.js, Fastify, Nest.js), GraphQL, PostgreSQL
- **DevOps and Infrastructure:** Docker, Ansible, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD
- **Data Processing:** Python ETL pipelines, SQL, Alteryx

I enjoy working with founders, startups, and businesses looking to build or scale their tech products — whether it's launching an MVP, optimizing an existing stack, or leading a team to delivery.
